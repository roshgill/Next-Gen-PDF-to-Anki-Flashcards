Cloze	Conceptual Database Design involves creating a {{c1::high-level description}} of the database.
Cloze	The design is precise enough that {{c1::technical people}} can understand it.
Cloze	The design is not so detailed that {{c1::non-technical people}} can’t participate.
Cloze	This design enables a straightforward translation into a {{c1::data model}} supported by a DBMS.
Cloze	The {{c1::E/R Model}} is an example that fits within Conceptual Database Design.
Cloze	Logical database design involves converting a conceptual design into a {{c1::database schema}}, tailored to a specific DBMS.

Cloze	ER Diagrams are used from requirement analysis to {{c1::logical database design}}.
Cloze	An ER Diagram provides a {{c1::visual syntax}} for database design that is clear for both technical and non-technical audiences.
Cloze	ER stands for {{c1::Entity and Relationship}}.
Cloze	In the example, the relationship from Product to Company is depicted as {{c1::Makes}}.
Cloze	An {{c1::entity}} is an individual object.
Cloze	An {{c1::entity set}} is a collection of similar entities.
Cloze	Entity sets are represented as {{c1::rectangles}} in ER diagrams.
Cloze	Entity sets are {{c1::not essentially disjoint}}.
Cloze	A specific {{c1::person}} is an example of an entity.
Cloze	A specific {{c1::product}} is an example of an entity.
Cloze	Similar entities have the same {{c1::attributes}}.
Cloze	In ER diagrams, attributes are represented by {{c1::ovals}} attached to an entity set.
Cloze	A product's unique identifier is its {{c1::name}}.
Cloze	A product's classification is defined by its {{c1::category}}.
Cloze	A product's cost is indicated by its {{c1::price}}.

Cloze	A relationship assigns element 3 from set A to element {{c1::c}}.
Cloze	The extra element in set B is {{c1::d}}, which remains unpaired.
Cloze	A relationship in mathematics is defined as the {{c1::cross-product}} of two sets.
Cloze	The cross-product of two sets is denoted by {{c1::A x B}}.
Cloze	A x B is the set of all {{c1::ordered pairs}} (a, b) where a is from A and b is from B.
Cloze	For A = {1,2,3} and B = {a,b,c,d}, the cross-product A x B produces {{c1::12}} pairs.
Cloze	A relationship is defined as a {{c1::subset}} of A x B.
Cloze	A x B is known as the {{c1::cross-product}} of sets A and B.
Cloze	For A = {1,2,3} and B = {a,b,c,d}, A x B contains {{c1::12}} pairs.
Cloze	A relationship between two entity sets is a {{c1::subset}} of all possible pairs of entities.

Cloze	A City {{c1::belongs to}} a Country.
Cloze	A River {{c1::crosses}} a Country.
Cloze	A River {{c1::ends in}} a Sea.
Cloze	Integrity constraints are database {{c1::rules}} that limit occurrences of certain events.
Cloze	A student cannot register for a course if it is already at {{c1::capacity}}.

Cloze	In an ER diagram, integrity constraints are represented as restrictions in {{c1::relationships}} or entities.
Cloze	Key Constraints of Relationships are indicated using {{c1::arrows}}.
Cloze	A relationship where each entity is paired with exactly one entity is known as a {{c1::one-to-one}} relationship.
Cloze	A relationship where several entities on the left correspond to a single entity on the right is defined as a {{c1::many-to-one}} relationship.
Cloze	The notation 'X -> Y' signifies a {{c1::function}} mapping from X to Y.
Cloze	A relationship where a single entity associates with several entities on the other side is known as a {{c1::one-to-many}} relationship.
Cloze	A relationship permitting multiple associations on both sides is characterized as a {{c1::many-to-many}} relationship.
Cloze	A company's identifier is its {{c1::name}}.

Cloze	In multiway relationships, the arrow indicates that given a {{c1::person}}, other details can be determined.
Cloze	In multiway relationships, knowing a person tells us {{c1::what they bought}}.
Cloze	In multiway relationships, knowing a person tells us the {{c1::store}} where the purchase was made.
Cloze	Arrows in multiway relationships show that each store uniquely determines the {{c1::product}} it sells.
Cloze	Arrows in multiway relationships show that each store uniquely determines the {{c1::person}} who shopped there.
Cloze	Arrows are used to denote relationships that involve multiple entities, known as {{c1::multiway relationships}}.
Cloze	The model's constraint that every person shops in at most one store is only an {{c1::approximation}}.
Cloze	Achieving a strict constraint that every person shops in at most one store requires additional modeling such as {{c1::aggregation}} or an extra entity.
Cloze	The multiway relationship example includes entities: Product, Purchase, Store, and {{c1::Person}}.
Cloze	Multiway relationships are converted into {{c1::binary relationships}}.
Cloze	The conversion process includes an additional attribute: {{c1::date}}.
Cloze	The role ProductOf links to the entity {{c1::Product}}.
Cloze	The linking relationship introduced is called {{c1::Purchase}}.
Cloze	The role StoreOf connects to the entity {{c1::Store}}.
Cloze	The role BuyerOf is associated with the entity {{c1::Person}}.
Cloze	The conversion from multiway relationships to binary involves creating a separate table for a {{c1::purchase}} event.
Cloze	The timestamp attribute in the purchase table is represented by the {{c1::date}}.
Cloze	The relationship linking a purchase to a product is captured by the {{c1::ProductOf}} relation.
Cloze	A purchase record is connected to the store through the {{c1::StoreOf}} relationship.
Cloze	The association between a purchase and the buyer is indicated by the {{c1::BuyerOf}} relation.
Cloze	A bold line indicates {{c1::total participation}}, meaning every entity appears at least once in the relationship.
Cloze	Total participation requires that every entity is involved in the relationship, in contrast with {{c1::partial participation}}.
Cloze	In the relationship 'Product makes Company', total participation ensures that every {{c1::product}} is linked to a company.
Cloze	The query 'Are there products made by no company?' is addressed by enforcing {{c1::total participation}}, which prevents such cases.
Cloze	Single-value Constraints combine a {{c1::key constraint}} with a total participation constraint.
Cloze	Under the key constraint, each product is made by {{c1::at most one}} company.
Cloze	Total participation requires that each product is made by {{c1::exactly one}} company.
Cloze	The geography ER diagram includes an entity named {{c1::Country}}.
Cloze	The Country entity is defined by attributes such as name, area, population, and {{c1::gdp}}.
Cloze	The geography ER diagram also includes an entity called {{c1::City}}.

Cloze	Another entity in the diagram is the {{c1::River}}, characterized by its name and length.
Cloze	The Sea entity in the ER diagram is represented with attributes name and {{c1::max depth}}.
Cloze	Each city in the diagram is associated with a single {{c1::country}}.
Cloze	A river in the geography diagram can cross one or several {{c1::countries}}.
Cloze	In the ER diagram, each river ends in a single {{c1::sea}}.
Cloze	A {{c1::Country}} entity in the Geography ER diagram includes the attributes name, area, population, and gdp.
Cloze	A {{c1::City}} entity in the Geography ER diagram includes the attributes name, population, longitude, and latitude.
Cloze	A {{c1::River}} entity in the Geography ER diagram is defined by the attributes name and length.
Cloze	A {{c1::Sea}} entity in the Geography ER diagram is characterized by the attributes name and max depth.
Cloze	Each city belongs to a single {{c1::country}}.
Cloze	Each river crosses one or several {{c1::countries}}.
Cloze	Each river ends in a single {{c1::sea}}.
Cloze	An entity may only be of interest when it is associated with a {{c1::related entity}}.
Cloze	A course name is significant only when it is coupled with a specific {{c1::university}}.
Cloze	A weak entity set derives its key from a {{c1::related entity set}}.
Cloze	The term 'Database class' differs from 'Database class offered by {{c1::Penn State}}.'
Cloze	In the given schema, cname represents a {{c1::course name}}.
Cloze	In the given schema, uname denotes a {{c1::university name}}.
Cloze	A weak entity set is one whose key is derived from {{c1::other entity sets}}.
Cloze	In the given example, cname functions as a {{c1::partial key}}.
Cloze	University is identified as the {{c1::supporting entity set}}.
Cloze	Offer is designated as the {{c1::supporting relationship}}.
Cloze	Key concept in object-oriented programming uses {{c1::subclasses}} to represent specialized entities.
Cloze	Declaring an 'A ISA B' relationship means every A entity is also considered {{c1::B}}.
Cloze	The Employee class is divided into two specialized types: {{c1::Contracted/Hourly}}.
Cloze	Overlap constraints evaluate whether an entity like Joe can be both {{c1::Hourly Employee}} and a Contract Employee.
Cloze	Covering constraints determine if every employee must be categorized as either {{c1::Hourly or Contract}}.
Cloze	Modeling a relationship involving another relationship set is achieved through {{c1::aggregation}}.
Cloze	Aggregation allows a relationship set (e.g., Employees) to be treated as an {{c1::entity set}} for other relationships.
Cloze	Distinct monitors and sponsors relationships are maintained instead of combining them into a {{c1::multi-way relationship}}.
Cloze	Each sponsorship is monitored by at most one {{c1::employee}}.
Cloze	ER Modeling can be {{c1::tricky}}!
Cloze	A concept can be modeled as an entity or as an {{c1::attribute}}.
Cloze	A concept may also be modeled as an {{c1::relationship}}.
Cloze	Identifying relationships involves choosing between {{c1::binary}} or multiway connections.
Cloze	Identifying relationships may require the use of {{c1::aggregation}}.
Cloze	The ER Model can capture a lot of {{c1::data semantics}}.
Cloze	Some constraints cannot be captured in ER diagrams and should be noted in the {{c1::conceptual design}}.
Cloze	Further refinement is carried out in the logical (relational) design as part of {{c1::DB design theory}}.
Cloze	An {{c1::entity}} is a distinct object with its own identity in data modeling.
Cloze	An {{c1::attribute}} is a property that describes an entity.
Cloze	Employee is typically modeled as an {{c1::entity}} in database design.
Cloze	Components such as Street, Addr, ZIP, Addr 1, and Addr 2 are treated as {{c1::attributes}} of an address.
Cloze	The term AddrOf signifies the {{c1::relationship}} between an employee and their address.
Cloze	When an employee has multiple addresses, the data model may require the address to be treated as an {{c1::entity}}.
Cloze	A simple attribute is often insufficient when internal structure, such as a {{c1::zip code}}, is relevant.
Cloze	When a property requires recording several values, the design typically opts for a separate {{c1::entity}}.
Cloze	The Address example illustrates the decision between modeling it as an {{c1::attribute}} or as a separate entity.
Cloze	Employee is connected to Address through the {{c1::AddrOf}} relationship.
Cloze	A person can only buy a specific product {{c1::once}}.
Cloze	The Purchase record illustrates a {{c1::relationship}} rather than an independent entity.
Cloze	The composite key in the purchase record is formed from Person.name, Product.name, and {{c1::Date}}.
Cloze	Using a new {{c1::entity}} instead of a relationship permits multiple instances of each entity combination.
Cloze	The design allows {{c1::multiple purchases}} per product, person pair.
Cloze	The transaction record begins with fields like {{c1::date}}, PID#, quantity, category, and price.
Cloze	The schema includes the entity named {{c1::Product}}.
Cloze	The relationship is indicated by the term {{c1::ProductOf}}.
Cloze	The schema also features the entity {{c1::Person}}.
Cloze	Ensuring that each policy is owned by {{c1::one employee}} prevents joint ownership.
Cloze	A policy may cover {{c1::multiple dependents}}, creating a one-to-many association.
Cloze	The binary relationship design is chosen over a multiway relationship to model policy ownership by a {{c1::single employee}}.
Cloze	The relationship linking employees and dependents is named {{c1::Covers}}.
Cloze	The policies table is defined with the unique attribute {{c1::policyid}} along with cost.
Cloze	A multiway relationship involves {{c1::more than two}} entities.
Cloze	A binary relationship involves exactly {{c1::two}} entities.
Cloze	Each policy is owned by a single {{c1::employee}}.
Cloze	A policy may cover multiple {{c1::dependents}}.
Cloze	The Policies table includes attributes like {{c1::policyid}}, cost, and name.
Cloze	Multiway relationships inherently involve {{c1::more than two}} entities.
Cloze	The Contracts relationship is a {{c1::multiway}} relationship connecting Parts, Departments, and Suppliers.
Cloze	The Contracts relationship includes a descriptive attribute called {{c1::quantity}}.
Cloze	No combination of binary relationships can adequately substitute for a {{c1::multiway}} relationship.
Cloze	Binary relationships cannot cleanly represent the concept of recording a specific {{c1::quantity}} in a contract.
Cloze	Connecting product, purchase, and store in one relationship depicts a {{c1::multiway}} association.
Cloze	Restricting each person to buying in a single store is achieved through a {{c1::membership}} association.
Cloze	The Product Purchase Person example erroneously restricts each person to {{c1::only one product}}.
Cloze	The President Country Person example incorrectly permits a country to have {{c1::multiple presidents}}.
Cloze	The design flaw in the President Country Person model highlights the need for every country to have a {{c1::president}}.
Cloze	The text title questions what is {{c1::wrong}} in the design.
Cloze	The element representing time is the {{c1::date}}.
Cloze	An item for sale is referred to as {{c1::Product}}.
Cloze	A location for transactions is indicated by the term {{c1::Purchase Store}}.
Cloze	The specific field for a person's address is noted as {{c1::personAddr}}.
Cloze	The specific field for a person's name is noted as {{c1::personName}}.
Cloze	It is suggested that people be conceived as {{c1::entities}}.
Cloze	Design criticism indicates that treating {{c1::dates}} as an independent entity is unnecessary.
Cloze	The singular term {{c1::date}} used in design introduces ambiguity.
Cloze	The inclusion of {{c1::Product}} represents the core item in the system.
Cloze	The term {{c1::Purchase Store}} denotes where a transaction occurs.
Cloze	The design considers the entity {{c1::Person}} to represent the user involved.
Cloze	The process moves from conceptual DB design to {{c1::Logical DB Design}}.
Cloze	A basic rule in database design is to transform an Entity Set into a {{c1::Relation}}.
Cloze	A Relationship is also transformed into a {{c1::Relation}} in the schema.
Cloze	The initial DB schema requires further {{c1::refinement}}.
Cloze	A powerful tool in database design theory is the concept of {{c1::functional dependencies}}.
Cloze	Ensuring database integrity involves adhering to {{c1::Normal Forms}}.
Cloze	Conceptual design follows {{c1::requirements analysis}}.
Cloze	Conceptual design yields a high-level description of {{c1::data to be stored}}.

Cloze	Additional constructs include {{c1::class hierarchies}}.
Cloze	Additional constructs include {{c1::aggregation}}.
Cloze	Integrity constraints include {{c1::key constraints}}.
Cloze	Integrity constraints include {{c1::participation constraints}}.
Cloze	Integrity constraints include {{c1::overlap/covering constraints}}.
Cloze	ER design is subjective and {{c1::tricky}}.
Cloze	ER design involves the choice between {{c1::entity vs. attributes}}.
Cloze	ER design involves the choice between {{c1::entity vs. relationship}}.
Cloze	ER design involves the choice between {{c1::binary vs. multiway relationships}}.
Cloze	ER design involves the choice between {{c1::aggregation vs. multiway relationships}}.
Cloze	The next step after conceptual design is {{c1::logical database design}} leading towards a relational DB schema.
Cloze	Entity sets are converted into {{c1::tables}} in relational database design.
Cloze	The SQL statement used to create a new table is {{c1::CREATE TABLE}}.
Cloze	The primary key in the Product table is set on the {{c1::name}} column.
Cloze	The Product table defines the price attribute using the {{c1::DECIMAL(2, 10)}} data type.
Cloze	Logical DB Design converts an ER diagram into a {{c1::relational}} model.
Cloze	The Orders table includes the attribute {{c1::prod-ID}}.
Cloze	The Orders table includes the attribute {{c1::cust-ID}} representing the customer identifier.
Cloze	The Orders table uses the attribute {{c1::date}} to record the order date.
Cloze	The Shipment table includes the attribute {{c1::name}} to specify the shipping company.
Cloze	The Shipping-Co table defines the attribute {{c1::address}} for the shipping company's location.
Cloze	The Shipment table uses a composite primary key consisting of {{c1::prod-ID, cust-ID, name}}.
Cloze	The Shipment table includes a foreign key on prod-ID and cust-ID that references {{c1::Order(prod-ID, cust-ID)}}.
Cloze	The foreign key on the name column in Shipment references the {{c1::Shipping-Co}} table.
Cloze	The prod-ID column in Shipment is defined with the data type {{c1::CHAR(6)}}.
Cloze	The cust-ID column in Shipment is declared with the data type {{c1::VARCHAR(60)}}.
Cloze	The date column in the Shipment table uses the data type {{c1::DATETIME}}.
Cloze	The Shipment table functions as a junction table that resolves a {{c1::many-to-many}} relationship.
Cloze	Many-to-one relationships connect multiple products to a single {{c1::company}}.
Cloze	The Product relation includes attributes such as name, category, price, and {{c1::makes}}.
Cloze	The Company relation is defined by attributes like name and {{c1::country}}.
Cloze	An example product provided is {{c1::iPhone 12}}.
Cloze	The category for iPhone 12 is {{c1::Electronics}}.
Cloze	iPhone 12 is listed with a price of {{c1::$700}}.
Cloze	Another example product is {{c1::iPad Pro}}.
Cloze	iPad Pro is priced at {{c1::$300}}.
Cloze	The product Office appears as an example in the table with the category {{c1::Software}}.
Cloze	Office is offered at a price of {{c1::$120}}.
Cloze	In the examples, Apple is the company making both iPhone 12 and iPad Pro, with its country noted as {{c1::US}}.
Cloze	The product Office is associated with the company {{c1::Microsoft}}.
Cloze	The constraints focus on {{c1::Combining Relations}} in relational design.
Cloze	One of the relations mentioned is the {{c1::Product}} relation.
Cloze	The Product relation includes attributes such as {{c1::name, category, price}}.
Cloze	The Make relation connects product and company information using {{c1::P.name C.name}}.
Cloze	An example product is {{c1::iPhone 12}}, listed with a price of $700.
Cloze	The iPad Pro is categorized under {{c1::Electronics}} in the Product relation.
Cloze	The Make relation shows that {{c1::Apple}} produces products like iPhone 12 and iPad Pro.
Cloze	The Company relation captures details such as {{c1::name, country}}.
Cloze	The Office product is classified as {{c1::Software}}.
Cloze	The Office product has a price of {{c1::$120}}.
Cloze	The Office product is linked with the company {{c1::Microsoft}}.
Cloze	The design intentionally avoids {{c1::separate relations}} for many-one relationships.
Cloze	The primary key of the Product table is {{c1::pname}}.
Cloze	The foreign key in the Product table is {{c1::cname}}.
Cloze	The foreign key in the Product table references {{c1::Company(name)}}.
Cloze	The data type for pname in the Product table is {{c1::VARCHAR(50)}}.
Cloze	The data type for category in the Product table is {{c1::VARCHAR(60)}}.
Cloze	The price column in Product uses the data type {{c1::DECIMAL(2, 10)}}.
Cloze	The Company table includes a column for the company's {{c1::country}}.
Cloze	A sample product row in Product is {{c1::iPhone 12}}, which is categorized as Electronics.
Cloze	Participation constraints capture details for {{c1::one entity set}} in a binary relationship.
Cloze	Binary relationships enforce {{c1::exactly once semantics}} when capturing participation constraints.
Cloze	In the Product table, the primary key is defined on the column {{c1::pname}}.
Cloze	The Product table specifies the column {{c1::cname}} as NOT NULL.
Cloze	The foreign key in the Product table references the {{c1::Company}} table.
Cloze	The general approach to translating ISA hierarchies uses {{c1::3 relations}}: Employees, Hourly_Emps, and Contract_Emps.
Cloze	The Employees relation is defined with attributes {{c1::ssn, name, lot}}.
Cloze	The Hourly_Emps relation includes a foreign key ssnFK along with {{c1::hourly wages}} and hours_worked.
Cloze	The Contract_Emps relation includes a foreign key ssnFK and the attribute {{c1::contractid}}.
Cloze	Queries involving only Hourly_Emps require a {{c1::join}} to access additional attributes.
Cloze	An alternative approach uses just {{c1::Hourly_Emps and Contract_Emps}} relations.
Cloze	In the alternative design, every employee must belong to {{c1::one of these two subclasses}}.
Cloze	Translating Aggregation requires treating a {{c1::relationship table}} as an entity.
Cloze	In aggregation, key constraints are used to combine {{c1::relations}}.
Cloze	The Monitors table includes foreign keys (pidFK_P, didFK_D, ssnFK_E) and the column {{c1::until}}.
Cloze	The Sponsor_Monitors table builds on Monitors by incorporating the column {{c1::since}}.
